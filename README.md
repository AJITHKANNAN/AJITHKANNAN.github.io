# AJITHKANNAN Website profile

Data Scientist specializing in Generative AI, Large Language Models (LLMs), and RAG pipelines with 4.75 years of experience (2.5 in core Data Science). I have designed and delivered end-to-end AI solutions in healthcare and enterprise domains, including chatbots, knowledge graphs, and multi-agent systems that improved efficiency by up to 70%.

Skilled in LangChain, HuggingFace, Haystack, and Vector databases(FAISS, Chroma), with expertise in NLP (intent/entity extraction, multilingual processing), deep learning, and MLOps (Docker, Jenkins, MLFlow, DVC). Proven success in optimizing model performance (8x latency reduction), boosting chatbot accuracy by 50%, and creating insight-driven dashboards that cut analysis time by 40%.

**Key Tools & Skills**: Generative AI | LLMs (Mistral, GPT, Phi, BERT, RoBERTa, Flan-T5) | RAG | NLP | LangChain | HuggingFace | Python | TensorFlow | MLOps (Docker, Jenkins, MLFlow, DVC) | GraphQL Knowledge Graphs(DGraph)

**PROJECT HIGHLIGHTS**
**1. Medical Knowledge Graph**
* Consolidated medical data from over 10 publicly available sources (25+ databases, 1,000+ tables, ~30 TB), enhancing data accessibility by 80% and ensuring seamless integration.
* Constructed a GraphQL-powered knowledge graph with Dgraph, optimizing query efficiency and Dockerized the solution for seamless scalability.
* Streamlined search precision with a keyword-based retrieval mechanism (90% accuracy) and extended its implementation to all accessible data sources, increasing knowledge discovery efficiency by 30%.

**2. Smart Chatbot Development with RAG & NLP Enhancements**
* Built a RAG-activated QA chatbot with Neural-Chat-7B, enhancing context-aware interactions by 30% and integrating PDF document retrieval via HayStack.
* Cut down latency by 85% through efficient quantization methods.
* Boosted conversational accuracy by 50% by integrating domain-specific knowledge and NLP advancements.

**3. Analytics Reporting & Insights Dashboards**
* Created interactive dashboards, cutting data analysis turnaround time by 40%.
* Enhanced customer service strategies with intent classification using DeBERTa-v3-large and GPT-2.
* Improved campaign effectiveness by 25% through Python-driven analytics and A/B testing.

I'm constantly seeking growth opportunities in this field and would welcome the chance to contribute fresh insights, drive results, and communicate data-driven decisions to your team.
